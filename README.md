## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Unity 6.2+
3. Ensure all required packages are installed
4. Open the AlienShooterDOTS configuration window: `Window > AlienShooterDOTS > Configuration Window`

### 2. Create Your First Scene
1. Create a new scene
2. Use the configuration window to add:
   - Player entity with `PlayerAuthoring` component
   - Enemy entities with `EnemyAuthoring` components
   - Spawn points with `SpawnPointAuthoring` components
3. Add input handling with `PlayerInputSystem` component on a GameObject

### 3. Customize Components
```csharp
// Example: Modify player stats
var playerAuthoring = playerGameObject.GetComponent<PlayerAuthoring>();
playerAuthoring.MaxHealth = 150f;
playerAuthoring.MoveSpeed = 8f;
playerAuthoring.DashSpeed = 20f;
```

### 4. Create Custom Weapons
```csharp
// Example: Setup a custom weapon
var weaponAuthoring = weaponGameObject.GetComponent<WeaponAuthoring>();
weaponAuthoring.WeaponType = WeaponTypeEnum.Rifle;
weaponAuthoring.Damage = 35f;
weaponAuthoring.FireRate = 8f;
weaponAuthoring.IsAutomatic = true;
```

## System Overview

### Player Movement System
- WASD/Arrow key movement with normalization
- Dash mechanics with cooldown system
- State management (Idle, Moving, Dashing, Dead)
- Physics-based movement integration

### Enemy AI System
- **Idle**: Rest state with transition timers
- **Patrol**: Random movement within defined radius
- **Chase**: Pursue player when in detection range
- **Attack**: Combat when in range with cooldown
- **Dead**: Death state handling

### Weapon System
- Semi-automatic and automatic firing modes
- Ammo management with reloading
- Multiple projectiles per shot (shotgun-style)
- Accuracy system with spread calculation
- Muzzle flash and effect integration

### Game Manager
- Wave-based enemy spawning
- Difficulty scaling per wave
- Score tracking and bonuses
- Game state management

## Integration Examples

### GPU Animation Integration
```csharp
// Play animation on entity
GPUAnimationUtils.PlayAnimation(entityManager, entity, CommonAnimationStates.RUN);

// Transition between animations
GPUAnimationUtils.TransitionToAnimation(entityManager, entity, 
    CommonAnimationStates.IDLE, CommonAnimationStates.ATTACK, 0.3f);
```

### Navigation Integration
```csharp
// Setup navigation agent
NavigationUtils.SetupNavigationAgent(entityManager, entity, maxSpeed: 5f);

// Set destination
NavigationUtils.SetDestination(entityManager, entity, targetPosition);

// Check if reached destination
bool hasArrived = NavigationUtils.HasReachedDestination(entityManager, entity);
```

### Physics Integration
```csharp
// Create explosion effect
PhysicsUtils.CreateExplosion(entityManager, explosionPosition, radius: 5f, damage: 50f);

// Setup health component
PhysicsUtils.SetupPhysicsHealth(entityManager, entity, maxHealth: 100f);
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Enemy Types
1. Extend the `EnemyTypeEnum` in `EnemyComponents.cs`
2. Create new authoring prefab with `EnemyAuthoring` component
3. Modify `GameManagerSystem` to include new enemy in spawn logic
4. Add custom AI behaviors in `EnemyAISystem` if needed

### Creating Custom Weapons
1. Add new weapon type to `WeaponTypeEnum`
2. Create weapon prefab with `WeaponAuthoring` component
3. Configure stats (damage, fire rate, ammo, etc.)
4. Customize projectile behavior in `WeaponSystem`

### Extending Player Abilities
1. Add new input actions to `PlayerInput` component
2. Extend `PlayerMovementSystem` for new movement abilities
3. Create additional state types in `PlayerStateType` enum
4. Update input handling in `PlayerInputSystem`

## Performance Considerations

### DOTS Best Practices
- Components are structs implementing `IComponentData`
- Systems use `IJobEntity` for parallel processing
- Burst compilation enabled for performance-critical systems
- Efficient queries using `SystemAPI`

### Memory Management
- Uses Unity's native collections for temporary data
- Proper disposal of query results and arrays
- Blob assets for complex data structures
- Entity command buffers for structural changes

### Scalability
- Systems designed for thousands of entities
- Parallel job scheduling where possible
- Minimal garbage collection through value types
- Efficient spatial queries and collision detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Components**: Ensure all required packages are installed
2. **Input Not Working**: Check `PlayerInputSystem` is attached to a GameObject
3. **Entities Not Spawning**: Verify authoring components are properly configured
4. **Performance Issues**: Enable Burst compilation and use Entity Debugger

### Debug Tools
- Use the Entity Debugger window: `Window > Entities > Debugger`
- Scene view overlay shows entity counts in play mode
- Configuration window provides validation tools
- Console logging in systems for debugging
